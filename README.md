**Please Note**: *StarWM is not in a very usable state as of yet. It is for this reason that there is very little documentation as it will most likely change quite quickly.*

# StarWM
StarWM is an extensible window manager written in Rust.

<img src="media/screenshot.png" width="100%">

# Why?
StarWM is a window manager that was initially started as an experiment. Nowadays, it's a community effort to create a window manager that can be used on your favourite linux distro. StarWM isn't really usable day to day just yet, but with ongoing work, we hope that it will provide a great experience. We aim to keep the codebase as clean as possible, so that anyone can read the code and understand with as little effort as possible. Feel free to have a look at the commit history and take the time to understand how it's constructed. You can use it to create your own WM, if you feel like it, just be sure to keep the GPL3 license if redistributing it. 

# Plans?
There are plans to make this extensible, possibly through a Lua interpreter. We are looking into if it could function perfectly as both a tiling and floating window manager, perhaps the addition of window decorations would also be possible.

# Installation
Currently StarWM is not packaged in any distribution,

Please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions
